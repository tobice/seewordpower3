# See? Frontend Template (3rd version)

New front end template for the website [See? Word Power](http://www.seewordpower.cz). Some
interesting features:

* **Incredibly small**. With gzip compression enabled, the homepage (which includes a custom font
 and retina quality intro photography) is just under 400kB.
* Fully responsive and retina ready.
* Little Easter egg: blinking face on the homepage.
* Light dev stack based on node.js together with assemble, handlebars, browserify and grunt.
